<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Model Engineering College ,Kerala. I am dedicated to mastering the art of technology. With a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to continuous learning, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of computing.</p>

<p>Technology excites me, and as a student, I'm on a journey to unravel its endless possibilities. Eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to the tech realm, I bring a blend of curiosity and determination. Certain skills that I have been working on include Web Development (NodeJs) ,Web Design (Figma) and Data Structures and Algorithms (C Programming). And what I might lack in skills I make up for my determination to learn.
